            <p>In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".<br>
                This architecture is called the client-server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services",<br>
                such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients or performing computations for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers.<br> 
                A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device.<br>
                Typical servers are database servers area are:<br>
                <li>servers mail servers</li> 
                <li>print servers</li>
